"Step 2" begins with...

Before you read the latest news articles or dive too deep into any specific area of your research topic, it's a good idea to lay down a general foundation by looking into the main people, organizations, places, milestones and other fundamental concepts related to the technology you're researching. A great place to find this sort of background information is an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is definitely a good option (you should read the entire wikipedia page for your topic), but keep in mind Wikipedia is collaboratively edited.

### Wikipedia

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), Wikipedia is "the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web and is one of the most popular websites by Alexa rank. It is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that operates on money it receives from donors." In the early days it was very easy to vandalize Wikipedia, and it initially got a reputation as an contentious resource. While everyone is still free and open to edit Wikipedia there's much more rigorous guidelines, filters and bots in place for maintaining the quality of the articles, and ensuring the information is verifiable and that the process is transparent. Here are some important/useful things to know when using Wikipedia:
- "All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a [neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) (NPOV), which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic."
- Given the policy on NPOV, the requirement for reliable sources means that you can not publish original research on Wikipedia and the sources editors use must be verifiable by the reader.
- When an article does not meet Wikipedia's standards it will usually get flagged, this can mean different things but generally an article will have a banner at the top explaining any issues pertaining to the current state of a given article. Take these seriously.
- It's a good idea to view the "Talk" page to see what the conversation around this particular article is, (are editors in agreement or is it a contentious subject?). The Talk page can be accessed by clicking the Talk tab next to the Article tab on every Wikipedia article.
- In addition to the talk page you can also view the history of changes (who made it, when did thye make it, what did they change) made to every article, these are similar (in fact inspired by) the "commits" we make in a repository with Git.
- When Wikipedia's bots, automated filters and senior editors aren't enough to stop vandalism of a page, perhaps because it's a particular controversial one, a page can be "locked". There are different types of locks (degrees to which editing restrictions are imposed on a page) and you can usually spot this lock on the top right hand corner of any article.

### Digesting your background research

After reading the Wikipedia page it's also a great idea to follow the links in the References section (at the bottom of every article). To guide you in this initial background research phase you should create a markdown file (.md) with the answers to the following guiding questions (this was due on Feb 27):
<ul>
  <li>Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?</li><br>

  <li> Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.</li><br>

  <li>What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?</li><br>

  <li>create a mind-map of connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area... for example:
    <img src="http://m3t4.media/images/mind-map-ex.png" alt="example mind map" style="width:100%">
  </li>
</ul>
